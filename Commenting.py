''' The first way of commenting a file or function is to put in a comment string using a tripple appostrophe

the first line is kind of a general description, then leave a line and write more, you don't need to leave a line after the first blank line if you don't want to, these comments are part of python, and pop up to help people using your code.'''

def someFunction(input):
    '''This function takes an input and does nothing
    
    This is an example of a functional comment'''
    pass
    #the hash character can be used to make a comment on a single line.
    
print(somefunction(someinput))
##fileout.write(something) #double hashes are sometimes used to camment out code which you may have used to test something
