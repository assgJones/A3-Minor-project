A3-Minor-project
================
This is a school collaborative project.

##PROBLEM
The school is part of a group of schools which takes part in a debating round.  Each school hosts a debate.  The debate is graded manually by a set of adjudicators, and the score sheets are left for analysis by the team coaches at the end of the round.  These scoring sheets however are often lost or do not make their way to the team coaches.  The current score sheets are quite complicated and require adjudicators to focus a lot on the marks awarded, rather than on the material of the debate.  Your task is to prepare, and market, an application which automates the routine tasks of the adjudicator, and eases the flow of information.
