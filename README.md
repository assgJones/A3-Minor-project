A3-Minor-project
================
This is a school collaborative project.

##PROBLEM
The school is part of a group of schools which takes part in a debating round.  Each school hosts a debate.  The debate is graded manually by a set of adjudicators, and the score sheets are left for analysis by the team coaches at the end of the round.  These scoring sheets however are often lost or do not make their way to the team coaches.  The current score sheets are quite complicated and require adjudicators to focus a lot on the marks awarded, rather than on the material of the debate.  Your task is to prepare, and market, an application which automates the routine tasks of the adjudicator, and eases the flow of information.   
##Specifications
  - The input will be Adjudicators opinions 
  - The output will be the Adjudicators feedback 
  - The maximum scores for Method and Matter would be 40, Matter would have a maximum    of 20.
  - Must run on a PC running windows 7,  Windows Vista, Processor of  2Ghz 
  - Does not require an Internet connection 
  - Intuitive, user friendly interface 
  - The output will be need to be sent by email, print or  web page 

## Brief
The adjudicators of the Debating Board have put in a request for a program that is to be used in debating to generate a score sheet with feedback for teams and coaches to look at at a later date.
